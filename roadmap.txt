LDAP test le notify restart ne marche pas, cf avec gitlab auth ca passait pa



postfix/mail.cf : line about certificate authority ??

new_vm role left as is so far


reboot did not work for gateway (had to co to reboot by hand)

dhcp restart networking changed

still some things not automated :
1) first VM : configure ansible user with sudo without password
2) DHCP does not have internet by default so can't contact gateway etc
3) DNS had his own ip has default dns, he should get 8.8.8.8 or he won't be able to resolve any domain names, modify its /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf file ?

4) ldap some pb about "/usr/bin/ldapmodify -H ldapi:// -Y EXTERNAL -f /root/addcerts.ldif" + startTLS (needed to do it by hand)
